        Managing your childâ€™s healthcare tasks online
      </h1>
	  <p>Most GP surgeries can give parents secure access to their children&rsquo;s GP services online or through linked profiles on the NHS App. This is known as proxy access. You can apply for this access through your GP surgery. This can take up to 4 weeks to set up depending on your GP surgery.</p>

	  <h2>About prescription view</h2>
	  
	  <p>We are introducing a new service called prescription view. It lets parents get access to their children&rsquo;s prescriptions instantly, without having to sign up through their GP surgery. Parents can apply for prescription view through <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/nhs-app-help-and-support/linked-profiles-in-the-nhs-app/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">linked profiles</a> on the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/about-the-nhs-app/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">NHS App</a>.</p>
	  
	  <p>We are aiming to develop this service so that:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
		  <li>we can invite all parents and carers to apply</li>
		  <li>parents can manage all parts of their child&rsquo;s healthcare tasks, reducing contact time with their GP surgery</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <h2>Benefits of prescription view</h2>
	  
	  <p>This new service allows you to use the NHS App or website to:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
		  <li>view your child&rsquo;s prescriptions</li>
		  <li>save time when it comes to managing your child&rsquo;s prescription</li>
		  <li>pick up your child&rsquo;s prescription at a pharmacy using a secure barcode</li>
		  <li>switch between your NHS profile and your child&rsquo;s linked profile</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <h2>Accessing your child&rsquo;s healthcare tasks online</h2>
	  
	  <p>If you want to manage other parts of your child&rsquo;s healthcare online, you will need to speak to your GP surgery to see what they can offer.</p>
	  
	  <p>As a parent, you can be set up to manage your child&rsquo;s online GP services such as:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
		  <li>ordering repeat prescriptions</li>
		  <li>booking appointments</li>
		  <li>viewing test results or vaccinations</li>
		  <li>accessing all or parts of their medical records</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>You will be asked to fill in a paper or digital form and return it to your GP surgery.</p>
	  
	  <p>The GP surgery will then:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
		  <li>check your details and your child&rsquo;s details that you&rsquo;ve put on the form</li>
		  <li>check that there are no safety issues that could stop you from linking your profile to your child&rsquo;s</li>
		  <li>decide if you can have the access you applied for and update their system to link you to your child&rsquo;s profile</li>
		  <li>let you know the outcome of your application and next steps</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>This application and approval process can take up to 4 weeks depending on your GP surgery.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Signing up to prescription view through the NHS App</h2>
	  
	  <p>You can apply for prescription view through linked profiles on the NHS App. This new service is quicker than applying through your GP surgery to view your child&rsquo;s prescription online.</p>
	  
	  <p>Before you can sign up to prescription view, you must be:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
		  <li>the parent who has given birth to the child &ndash; this is because we are only able to verify this relationship at this stage of the service</li>
		  <li>be able to provide proof of your relationship to the child (for example, with a birth certificate)</li>
		  <li>living with your child at the same address</li>
		  <li>registered at the same GP surgery as your child</li>
		  <li>registered on <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/nhs-login/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">NHS login</a> and NHS App</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>If you have more than one child aged 10 or under, you can apply for them, too.</p>
	  
	  <p>You can only add a child to prescription view if:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
		  <li>they are aged 10 or under</li>
		  <li>they do not have a child protection plan</li>
		  <li>you, your child or anyone in your household does not have a safeguarding issues raised by social services or your local authority</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <h2>Getting started with prescription view</h2>
	  
	  <p>Please have yours and your child's personal details ready before applying for prescription view.</p>
	  <p>You will be asked to agree to share your personal details with this new service.</p>
	  
	  <p>You will also be asked to share your child&rsquo;s:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
		  <li>name</li>
		  <li>date of birth</li>
		  <li>address</li>
		  <li>NHS number</li>
		  <li>GP surgery&#39;s name and address</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>If your child has a child protection plan in place or a safguarding issue has been raised in your household, you will need to let us know when applying for prescription view in the NHS App.</p>
	  
	  <p>Your child&rsquo;s data is stored securely in a way that follows the <a href="https://access.login.nhs.uk/privacy">NHS login privacy notice</a>. It will be shared securely when you are setting up prescription view in the NHS App.</p>
	  
	  <p>After you have been approved for prescription view, you can view your child&rsquo;s linked profile in your NHS App.</p>
